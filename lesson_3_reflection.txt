When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working from another computer, or on a shared project that you don't want to push everything from your local repository to.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This could be frustrating if you were working on a project with multiple people, always pulling from the remote.  Also, you may want to make a new branch that doesnt pull from the remote.  Also a bunch of other things.
