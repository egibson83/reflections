What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file is created.  This starts the git repository...I think.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
you can compare the content in the staging area to the latest commit and decide if the commit is logical.
