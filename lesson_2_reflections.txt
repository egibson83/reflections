What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file is created.  This starts the git repository...I think.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary placeholder for files to be added to the commit.  This allows for the commit to be organized before anything is saved.
